To log out of the website the user will have to click on the top right icon next to their GitHub icon. Once log out is clicked the user will be logged out and redirected back to the homepage.

### <u>Learn Page</u>

Learn page is a collection of algorithms, each algorithm can be opened and users are prompted with a visual of the algorithm, an explanation or pseudocode and the JavaScript implementation.

### <u>Practice Page</u>

Learn page is a collection of problems users are working on and practicing their algorithm knowledge. Users can browse through problems and click on any problem to open it and work on. Users can click on filter which will give them the ability to filter by catagory. If user clicks on Create New Problem, the user will be redirected to a problem creation page. On this page they must enter a Problem Name and description, users can add catagories, and must enter at least 3 test cases that the code will test once ran.
